Have Just Two languages WPML website? Replace default WMPL language switcher with this very quick menu item.

== Description ==
Acme WPML Language Switch is a simple language switch appended to your menu.

If you have only two active languages you have the chance to replace the default WPML switch functionality (that lists the active translations, including current) into this simple menu item.

Once installed the plugin will create a new Menu ACME and a 'Language Switch' submenu on you WordPress darshboard.
The plugin will automatically check you current WPML version (3.2 as minimun requirements) and active languages.

From plugin settings you can customize the label and select the menu you want the switch will display. You can even choose its position inside menus (as first menu item rather than last).
This plugin will also append a new css class as a quick handle for CSS or Javascript purposes.

If you only run two languages in your website and you are looking for a quick smart customized language switch, we strongly recommend you Acme WPML Language Switch.
